Scribble.rs is an alternative to the web-based drawing game skribbl.io. My main
problems with skribbl.io were the ads and the fact that a disconnect would
cause you to lose your points. On top of that, the automatic word choice was
quite annoying and caused some frustration.

The site will not display any ads or share any data with third parties.

## Play now

There are some community hosted versions of the game (feel free to host your own instance and add it here!):
 - [scribblers.fly.dev](https://scribblers.fly.dev) (Official instance, Note
that the instance may not respond instantly, as it automatically shuts down
if no traffic is received.)
 - [scribble.bixilon.de](https://scribble.bixilon.de) (community instance maintained by @Bixilon)
 - [scribble.drifty.win](https://scribble.drifty.win) (community instance maintained by @driftywinds for better latency in Asia)

## Donation

I haven't really accepted donations for a long time. But I think the project is
polished enough now to dare taking some money. Right now the hosting is very
minimal and there's no domain. The server is located in amsterdam and many
people playing seem to be from outside of europe. So it'd be nice to have a
decentralised deployment to provide a nice experience for everyone.

So donations would go towards infrastructure and a domain!

In the future I might add some fun little benefits for donators, I have no clear
vision of it yet though.

## Configuration

Configuration is read from environment variables or a `.env` file located in
the working directory.

Available settings:

| Key                                       | Description                                                      | Default | Required |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| PORT                                      | HTTP port that the server listens to.                            | 8080    | True     |
| NETWORK_ADDRESS                           | TCP address that the server listens to.                          |         | False    |
| ROOT_PATH                                 | Changes the path (after your domain) that the server listens to. |         | False    |
| CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS                      |                                                                  | *       | False    |
| CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS                    |                                                                  |         | False    |
| LOBBY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL                    |                                                                  | 90s     | False    |
| LOBBY_CLEANUP_PLAYER_INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD |                                                                  | 75s     | False    |

For more up-to-date configuration, read the
[config.go](/internal/config/config.go) file.

## Docker

It is recommended that you run the server via Docker, as this will rule out
almost all compatibility issues.

Starting from v0.8.5, docker images are only built on tagged pushes. Each git
tag becomes a docker tag, however `latest` will always point to the latest
version released via GitHub.

### Linux Docker

Download the image:

```shell
docker pull biosmarcel/scribble.rs:latest
```

### Windows Docker

Only use this one if you want to run a native Windows container. Otherwise use
the Linux variant, as that's the default mode on Windows:

```shell
docker pull biosmarcel/scribble.rs:windows-latest
```

### Running the Docker container

Run the following, replacing `<port>` with the port you want the container to be
reachable from outside:

```shell
docker run --pull always --env PORT=8080 -p <port>:8080 biosmarcel/scribble.rs:latest
```

For example:

```shell
docker run --pull always --env PORT=8080 -p 80:8080 biosmarcel/scribble.rs:latest
```

Note that you can change `8080` too, but it is the internal port of the
container and you shouldn't have to change it under normal circumstances.

## Building / Running

Dependencies:
  * [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) version 1.23.3 or later
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/) (You can also download a .zip from Github)

In order to download and build, open a terminal and execute:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs.git
cd scribble.rs
go build ./cmd/scribblers
```

This will produce a portable binary called `scribblers` or `scribblers.exe` if
you are on Windows.

## Pre-compiled binaries

In the [Releases](https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs/releases) section
you can find the latest stable release.

Alternatively each commit uploads artifacts which will be available for a
certain time.

**Note that these binaries might not necessarily be compatible with your
system. In this case, please use Docker or compile them yourself.**

## nginx 

Since Scribble.rs uses WebSockets, when running it behind an nginx reverse
proxy, you have to configure nginx to support that. You will find an example
configuration on the [related Wiki page](https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs/wiki/reverse-proxy-(nginx)).

Other reverse proxies may require similar configuration. If you are using a
well known reverse proxy, you are free to contribute a configuration to the
wiki.

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute:

* Update / Add documentation in the wiki of the GitHub repository
* Extend this README
* Create feature requests and bug reports
* Solve issues by creating Pull Requests
* Tell your friends about the project
